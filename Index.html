            <p><b> Releases and Revenue </b></p> <p> The trilogy's online promotional trailer was first released on 27 April 2000, and set a new record for download hits, registering 1.7 million hits in the first 24 hours of its release.[42] The trailer used a selection from the soundtrack for Braveheart and The Shawshank Redemption among other cuts. In 2001, 24 minutes of footage from the series, primarily the Moria sequence, was shown at the Cannes Film Festival, and was very well received.[43] The showing also included an area designed to look like Middle-earth.[27]

The Fellowship of the Ring was released 19 December 2001. It grossed $47 million in its U.S. opening weekend and made around $871 million worldwide. A preview of The Two Towers was inserted just before the end credits near the end of the film's theatrical run.[44] A promotional trailer was later released, containing music re-scored from the film Requiem for a Dream.[45] The Two Towers was released 18 December 2002. It grossed $62 million in its first U.S. weekend and out-grossed its predecessor with $926 million worldwide. The promotional trailer for The Return of the King was debuted exclusively before the New Line Cinema film Secondhand Lions on 23 September 2003.[46] Released 17 December 2003, its first U.S. weekend gross was $72 million, and became the second film (after Titanic) to gross over $1 billion worldwide.

          <div class="subR1">
          <p><b> Public and Responses </b></p> <p> Unadjusted for inflation, The Lord of the Rings film series is the highest-grossing film trilogy worldwide of all time, higher even than other film franchises such as the original Star Wars trilogy and The Godfather trilogy.[58] The film series grossed a total of $2.91 billion[59] and also tied a record with Ben-Hur and Titanic for the total number of Academy Awards won for a single film, with The Return of the King receiving eleven Oscars.[60]


The majority of critics have also praised the series, with Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times writing that "the trilogy will not soon, if ever, find its equal".[61] Some were critical of the films' pacing and length: "It's a collection of spectacular set pieces without any sense of momentum driving them into one another" according to Philadelphia Weekly.[62]


On Rotten Tomatoes, the films received approval ratings of 91%, 95%, and 93% respectively.[63][64][65] Metacritic, based on its ratings for each film (92, 87, and 94 respectively),[66][67][68] features the series within the top ten of the best films of the decade.[69] As of July 2016, every film is placed in the top 200 of Metacritic's 'Best Movies of all Time' list.[70] In CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave the films an average grade of A-, A, and A+ respectively on an A+ to F scale.[71]  </p>
